# Roadmap

We're constantly releasing new features and improvements to our platform. If there's a feature you would like to see on our platform, send us an email at [support@roqr.app](mailto:support@roqr.app).

### Conditional QR codes
Redirect scanners to different resources based on conditions, such as the number of times the code has been scanned, or from which country the code is scanned.

### Webhooks
Send a webhook to a URL to react to events on the platform. This can be used to automate behavior, or build extensions such as a Slack bot that notifies you about events.

### Gradients
Add even more flair to your QR codes with gradient colors.

### Frames
Add a frame around your QR code, with a call-to-action such as "Scan Me".
