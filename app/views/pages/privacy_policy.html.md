## As a customer of RoQR

We strive to collect as little data about you as possible.

When signing in to RoQR, a session cookie is used to keep you logged in to the website. The cookie only lasts for the length of the browser session, unless you click the `Remember me` checkbox when logging in, in which case we will remember that you're logged in between browser sessions (up to 14 days). 

Our website and data are hosted by Fly.io. See [Fly.io's privacy policy for more details](https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/).

### Retention of your data

We retain your information as long as your account is active in order to provide you with the services on our platform.

We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect RoQRâ€™s legal rights.

You can choose to delete your account at any time. All your data will be permanently deleted immediately when you delete your account.

## QR code scanners

We track anonymized data about individuals who scan dynamic QR codes created through our platform (i.e., your customers). Specifically, we track these items:
- Time of scan
- Which QR code was scanned
- Browser name (Chrome, Firefox, etc)
- Browser version
- Device name (iPhone, Kindle, Samsung, etc)
- Platform name (Android, IOS, etc)
- Platform version
- Language (English/United States, etc)
- City
- Country

City and country are estimated based on the IP address of the request, but the IP address itself is not stored.

### Do not track

"[Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/)" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. RoQR respects individuals who ask to not be tracked through this preference by only recording the first two items from the list above if their browser sends the DNT header.
